      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to introduce tourists to the fascinating history and significance of Olumo Rock in Abeokuta. Olumo Rock served as a crucial refuge for the old Egba people in 1830 during a turbulent period in their history. Because of its pivotal role in the community's past, the rock has been revered and even deified as a god. It is believed that the rock was benevolently molded by a divine force that also brought an end to the wandering and strife of the people. As a result, annual sacrifices are performed to honor the gods, seeking their protection for climbers and to commemorate Olumo Rock's vital role in the old Egba people's lives.</p>

        Olumo Rock is situated in the vibrant city of Abeokuta, within Ogun State. Historically, this rock formation served as a natural fortress, offering sanctuary to the Egbas during inter-tribal warfare in the 19th century. It played a crucial role in safeguarding the Egba people when they needed it most, and today, it continues to hold a special place in the hearts of the local community. The locals are known for their warm and friendly hospitality, often offering informal tours of the dyeing areas to curious tourists.
